# spam-classifier

## Overview
This project implements a Spam Classifier designed to accurately distinguish between legitimate (ham) and unsolicited (spam) messages. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this classifier provides an effective solution for identifying and filtering unwanted communications.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing text data, such as tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words.

Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates various classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, etc.) to identify the most effective model for spam detection.

Model Evaluation: Provides metrics to assess model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interactive Prediction (Optional): (If applicable, describe how users can test the classifier with their own input)

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:

pandas (for data manipulation)

numpy (for numerical operations)

scikit-learn (for machine learning models and utilities)

nltk (for natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stop words)

(Add any other libraries you used, e.g., matplotlib, seaborn for visualization, jupyter for notebooks)

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x). You'll also need to install the required libraries.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

````Bash````

````git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-spam-classifier.git
cd your-spam-classifier
Install dependencies:

(````Bash````)

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, you can create one by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all your project's dependencies, or list them manually as pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk etc.)

## Usage
Data Preparation:
(Describe how to obtain or prepare the dataset. E.g., "Place your dataset (spam_ham_dataset.csv or similar) in the data/ directory.")

Run the Classifier:
(Provide clear instructions on how to run your main script. For example:)

Bash

python train_classifier.py
(If your project involves multiple steps or scripts, describe them here. E.g., python preprocess_data.py, then python train_model.py, then python predict.py)

Make Predictions (Optional):
(If you have a script for making predictions on new data, explain how to use it.)

Bash

python predict_spam.py "Hey, you've won a free iPhone! Click here to claim."

## Dataset
(Briefly describe the dataset you used for training and testing your classifier. For example:)
The dataset used for this project consists of SMS messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). It was sourced from [mention source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository] and contains approximately [Number] entries.

## Results
(Summarize the performance of your best model. You can include a small table or just state the key metrics.)
The final spam classifier model achieved the following performance on the test set:

Accuracy: [e.g., 98.2%]

Precision (Spam): [e.g., 96.5%]

Recall (Spam): [e.g., 95.8%]

F1-Score (Spam): [e.g., 96.1%]

## Future Enhancements
Experiment with more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., Word Embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe).

Explore deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) for classification.

Integrate a user interface for easier interaction.

Deploy the model as a web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).

Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
