# spam-classifier

## Overview
This project implements a Spam Classifier designed to accurately distinguish between legitimate (ham) and unsolicited (spam) messages. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this classifier provides an effective solution for identifying and filtering unwanted communications.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing text data, such as tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words.

Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates various classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, etc.) to identify the most effective model for spam detection.

Model Evaluation: Provides metrics to assess model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interactive Prediction (Optional): (If applicable, describe how users can test the classifier with their own input)

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
